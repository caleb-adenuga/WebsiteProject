    <p1>
        My athletic career started in primary school and I started taking part in school athletics and I was pretty good at everything and i was very athletic, I was racing people who were
        much older than me and I still won. At this point i decided to join a track and field club called sale harriers and i started going to training twice a week.<br>

        High School
    </h3>

<p2>
    In year 7 I immediately joined the athletics team because on transition day before we started year 7 I was noticed for my blistering speed in the races beating everybody else by far. 
    So the sport teachers immediately asked me to join the athletics and every couple months the schools in Manchester would have competitions with other schools like Trinity, St Peters etc.
    I took part in the 100m, 200m, long jump and the relay. I would win all of my events but depending on where everyone else in my school came my school didnt always come first place but
    what was important was that I won all my events. And as I progressed through high school I was focusing more on my peformance at sale harriers other than my peformance at high school.

        I joined <a href="https://www.saleharriersmanchester.com/" target="_blank">Sale Harriers</a> in 2013 and I did the long jump, hurdles, 100m, 200m, 300m, 4x100m relay and the 4x400m relay. 
        Sounds like a lot right?, I did all these events and in 2014 I was 2nd in the whole of the UK, to see my other records and personal bests click this link <a href="https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=696082 /" target="_blank">Check my records</a>
